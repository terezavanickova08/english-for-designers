### Presentation text

I prepare for you little bit different type of topics for my presentation and today I will talk about quarantine and how quarantine and online school change my life. Honestly this topic of presentation is really personal from me also this presentation is little bit challange for me, so it will be funny. 

You know about me that I’m Tereza, I study graphic design and this is my story how I started life new healthy lifestyle. 

Eleven of March. This is the date when started our online school. At the begining I did only things for school and work and thats all.

But it started in April. It was absolutely impulsive decision. I started eat healthier and I started did workouts at home. This is are some my photos from quarantine. I started running, we were many times on Krkonoše mountains, because we love it. I had too some small injury from the Krkonoše mountains and I also cooked a lot of healthy food. And I also study about human body, what our body need, how to be healthy and so on.

How I said, my way started in April with Jillian Michales. I started her 90 days body revolution programme. I tis programme for 3 months, where you work with dumbells but you also do a cardio training and every two weeks are different and harder workouts. I thing that this programme was the best choise which I can made. I had reccomendation for this programme from my sister, she is fitness lover too and at the end od the programme I canno’t believe that I really work 3 months every day with Jillian. It was perfect start for me, because her workouts are very complex for human body.

If you want to loose some weight you must definittely change your food. 80% is healthy food and 20% are workouts. Phisicly, your body start loose weight if you will set up your caloric deficit -10%. In my case it was 2.226 calories and from it it was 30% of protein, 40% of carbohydrates and 30% of fat. This is very important. Don’t set up your caloric deficit to more that 10%, it is not healthy and natural for your body. 

Macronutriens are protein, carbohydrate and fat. Human body need all the macronutriens. Even if you loose weight you also need to eat fat, but healthy fat. For exampe avocado, nutns, for example sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds, olives or olive oil. Some people think that if you want to lose weight you must eat only salads but It’s not true.

Motivation and mindset. This is very cliche but true. You need to have motivation and have a good mindset if you want to do anything. Also I thing that our body and our brain is very powerful and also many times we can do more that we think. I believe that if you will take care about your body, your body will give it back to you. 

You will not loose weignt aftr one healthy meal just as you will not gain weight after one unhealthy meal. Why I say it?

In September I had my first unhleathy food after started of my way. At the begining I said to me, that I sometimes want eat somethink more unhleathy but when I will happy in my body and when I will have any special day. This was the day. My boyfriend got a bachelor’s degree and we were for the lunch and I had taste for pizza. Honestly my stomach after hurt a lot. 

After 90 days body revolution a made also next programmes with Jillian Michales – 6 weeks six pack, killer abs or for example no more trouble zones.

I think that I have some expreriences so I create my own fitness plan. I’m doing workout with dumbells but also I did twice a week some cardio training. It can be seems that it is a lot, but i work half an hour in a day. On tuesday I have one hour training but normally I work half an hour.

And here are something about HIIT and cardio training which I work. Hiit is a training which help build strength. And in cardio training you are doing some rhytmic aktivity that raises your hearth rate into your target hearth rate zone where you will burn the most fat and calories.

My reccomendations for you are: Study, If you are interest in somethink study it. If you will not study it can be also dangerous for your body. The second point is Eat regulary I eat five times a day. Third point is Eat all macronutriens, really, this is very iportatnt for you body. Next point is – be grateful. Be grateful for everything, and be grateful for what you body can do and how much is your body strong.

And the last point is that you don’t have to be afraid that you will look like Arnold if you will start work with dumbells.

And during the quarantine I create my instagram profile where a I post some recipies for healthy food and some my tips and motivation.

Yeah and this is my annoing dog. Everytime when I’m doing some exercise on the floor he think’s that I’m dying and want to save me. Maybe that I sometimes look that I’m dying, but I’m still alive and I love it. 

And thats all from me. This was my story to the healthy lifestyle. Be healthy, fit and happy.
