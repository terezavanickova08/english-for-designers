# Chapter VI
When I was in high school in drawing class, we often started by redrawing paintings by famous artists and learning from the masters themselves. In my opinion, the fact that we copied the paintings of famous painters helped us to find our own style in drawing. Despite the fact that my classmates and I copied the same image, neither image of one of us was the same. What could we as designers do if we could not learn from the masters themselves in their field?
# Two points of view on copying 
Everyone is copying and I don't mean it wrong. I think that copying has got two points of view. The first point is that copying can teach us something and the second one is that some people copying and trying to do that the work did they. 
# Copying in art: Mona Lisa, most parodied artwork? 
Some well-known works of art are copied and redesigned to the current. Perfect example is for example Mona Lisa from Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo da Vinci painted Mona Lisa portrait between years 1503â€“1506. By the way, there are many conspiracy theories about Mona Lisa. For example, that the Mona Lisa is Leonardo da Vinci himself. But I don't want to write about it today, I want to write today about some redesigns of Mona Lisa. How I said, Mona Lisa is very famous portrait and I think that at this time is Mona Lisa too the most parodied and copyied artwork. Here are some examples: 

<img src="./Mona Lisa/af4.png" alt="af4" width="300"/>n<img src="./Mona Lisa/10e323697fc7199b06c5ada9e5c95eb7.jpg" alt="10e323697fc7199b06c5ada9e5c95eb7" width="300"/>

#### - But the Mona Lisa is not the only parodied work. Here are some more examples:

<img src="./Next examples/next.jpg" alt="next" width="300"/>

# Conclusion
I do not have a clear opinion on these works. But I wonder what Leonardo da Vinci or Vincent van Gogh, for example, would say. As I said, copying is all around us, everyone is copying even if they don't realize it.
