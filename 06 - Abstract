The diary from Siberian captivity reflects the journey from captivity in distant Siberia, which was experienced by my great-grandfather Blažej Homola, born in 1880. He was called to the front on July 31, 1914 and had no choice but to leave his family and hope for a happy return.
	On October 22, 1914, he was captured and reached Siberia, where he spent several years. Blažej Homola, like several other men, was an ordinary man who just wanted to get home for his beloved family and the war was a suffering for him. 
	My bachelor's thesis is also created to celebrate the centenary of the return of the legionnaires to your homes, which is celebrated this year.
	In the theoretical part of my bachelor's thesis, I describe the situation on the Siberia with help of experts from the Czech Military History Institute, family and professional literature.
	In the practical part, I will present a SWOT analysis, my advertising campaign and web design which I made for the book.

Key words: Czechoslovak, book design, legionnaires, printed publication, diary
