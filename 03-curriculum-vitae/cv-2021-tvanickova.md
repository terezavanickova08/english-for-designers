# SKILLS
- From the Adobe CC library I love Illustrator and InDesign. InDesign is perfect for typesetting books and Illustrator for logo design, for example. But I also have a lot of experience with Photoshop, After Effect and Adobe Premiere or even Adobe XD. Cinema 4D is the perfect tool for creating 3D visualizations, and Microsoft Office is a typical tool for everyday use.
